title:      Using Docker to Run Everything From a Single Server
date:       2017-05-25

summary: Often it is desirable to install several web pages or web applications
    in the same server, in order to minimize costs. However this is not so
    easy and presents some challenges.  We will discuss several ways of
    trying to accomplish it, and argue that using Docker is the most
    efficient and the most easy one. We will also see some use cases of
    applications that can be installed with Docker, which actually make
    use of some custom shell scripts that I have developed.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
Often it is desirable to install several web pages or web applications
in the same server, in order to minimize costs. However this is not so
easy and presents some challenges.  We will discuss several ways of
trying to accomplish it, and argue that using Docker is the most
efficient and the most easy one. We will also see some use cases of
applications that can be installed with Docker, which actually make
use of some custom shell scripts that I have developed.
</p>
</div>
</div>


<div id="outline-container-orgheadline2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgheadline2"><span class="section-number-2">2</span> The Problem</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
Usually a small organization or institution has limited resources and
it makes sense to use them as efficiently as possible. For example
let's say they have a single server with public IP and would like to
install in it their website, several web applications,
etc. Traditionally this is done by installing all the applications and
their dependencies in the same place, and trying to fix their
configurations so that they coexist peacefully with each-other. We can
use the name-based virtual hosting of apache2 to host several
domains/subdomains on the same webserver.
</p>

<p>
However the issue is a little bit more complicated than this, because
sometimes it is not possible (or suitable, or convenient) to host two
different websites on the same server. For example, let's say that a
website is built on Joomla, and it has some modules that do not work
well with the latest version of PHP, so it depends on the previous
version of PHP. Now we have to install manually the previous version
of PHP and this makes the whole thing more difficult. Moreover, this
previous version of PHP is not suitable or may break the other
websites or applications, which require the latest version of PHP. So,
we will have to keep 2 parallel installations of PHP, each one for a
different version, and to configure each website or application for
using the right version.
</p>

<p>
This makes very high the complexity of installation, configuration and
maintenance. Sometimes it may even be impossible due to conflicting
dependencies. The only solution in this case would be to separate
these websites/applications into two different servers, one that has
the previous version of PHP and another with the latest one. But now
it is more expensive (because requires two or more servers, instead of
one). It also requires more than one public IP, one for each server,
which sometimes is more expensive, and sometimes is simply not
possible.
</p>
</div>
</div>


<div id="outline-container-orgheadline3" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgheadline3"><span class="section-number-2">3</span> Using an HTTP Reverse Proxy</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
In this case, the Reverse Proxy module of apache2 comes to rescue. The
idea is that the main webserver can forward the http requests to the
other webservers, behaving like a kind of http gateway or hub. So, we
need a public IP only for the proxy server and all the requests for
each of the hosted domains/subdomains go to it. Then it will use the
name-based virtual hosting feature of apache2 to distinguish between
them, and forward each of them to the appropriate internal server,
acting as a proxy between the webclient and the webserver.
</p>

<p>
The apache2 configuration on the proxy server looks like this:
</p>
<pre class="example">
&lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt;
        ServerName site1.example.org
        ProxyPass / http://site1.example.org/
        ProxyPassReverse / http://site1.example.org/
        ProxyRequests off
&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;
</pre>
<p>
There is a section like this for each domain/subdomain that is hosted.
</p>

<p>
Now, the tricky part is to modify <code>/etc/hosts</code> and to add lines like
this for each supported domain/subdomain:
</p>
<pre class="example">
192.168.1.115  site1.example.org
</pre>
<p>
Here <code>192.168.1.115</code> is the internal IP of the webserver that hosts
the domain <code>site1.example.org</code>. Without this configuration apache2
would not know where to forward the request, the request would be sent
again to the proxy server itself, and this would create an endless
loop.
</p>

<p>
For handling HTTPS requests, the configuration of apache2 would look
like this:
</p>
<pre class="example">
&lt;VirtualHost _default_:443&gt;
        ServerName site1.example.org
        ProxyPass / https://site1.example.org/
        ProxyPassReverse / https://site1.example.org/

        ProxyRequests off

        SSLEngine on
        SSLCertificateFile      /etc/ssl/certs/ssl-cert-snakeoil.pem
        SSLCertificateKeyFile   /etc/ssl/private/ssl-cert-snakeoil.key
        #SSLCertificateChainFile /etc/ssl/certs/ssl-cert-snakeoil.pem

        SSLProxyEngine on
        SSLProxyVerify none
        SSLProxyCheckPeerCN off
        SSLProxyCheckPeerName off
        SSLProxyCheckPeerExpire off
&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;
</pre>

<p>
Also these apache2 modules have to be enabled:
</p>
<pre class="example">
a2enmod ssl proxy proxy_http proxy_connect proxy_balancer cache headers rewrite
</pre>
</div>
</div>


<div id="outline-container-orgheadline4" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgheadline4"><span class="section-number-2">4</span> Using Virtual Machines</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">
<p>
Instead of using a separate physical machine for the proxy server and
for each of the webservers, we can use virtual machines inside a
single physical machine. This brings some benefits in terms of
management and maintenance because it is easier to manage a virtual
machine than a physical one. For example you can make a snapshot of
the virtual machine (which is like a full backup of everything), you
can make a clone of it and use the clone for testing new
installations/configurations, you have more flexibility in increasing
or decreasing the resources of the virtual machine (for example
increasing the amount of RAM if needed), etc.
</p>

<p>
However, the machine that hosts the virtual servers has to be more
powerful than a normal server. It needs to have more RAM, more
processing power, faster storage, etc. because these resources are
divided among the virtual servers. For example, suppose that we need
to have 3 webservers, one for each website or webapp. We also need a
webproxy server, as discussed in the previous section, to handle the
http requests for all the domains.  If we assume that each webserver
needs at least 512MB of RAM to run properly, then for these 4 virtual
machines we need at least 2GB or RAM. The host system as well needs at
least 512MB of RAM to run properly, so in total we would need a
machine with at least 2-3 GB of RAM.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, if we were able run all the websites and webapps on
the same server, without separating them into different machines, 1GB
of RAM would be more than enough for running everything properly.
This happens because each virtual machine has to spend resources for
running its own system, its own apache2 server etc. so in total they
need more resources than a single server.
</p>

<p>
Besides this, another problem is that once some resources are
allocated to a virtual machine they cannot be shared with the other
virtual machines, even if they are idle (unused). For example, suppose
that we allocate 512MB of RAM to virt-ws-1 and 512MB or RAM to
virt-ws-2. Let's also say that when virt-ws-1 is very busy virt-ws-2
is idle, and when virt-ws-1 is idle virt-ws-2 is very busy. Even
though one of them is idle, it cannot share its free resources (RAM)
with the busy one because the virtual machines and their allocated
resources are totally isolated from each-other. If both applications
were installed on the same server though, they would have been able to
use the whole 1GB available, while they are busy and the other one is
idle.
</p>
</div>
</div>


<div id="outline-container-orgheadline5" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgheadline5"><span class="section-number-2">5</span> Using Docker</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-5">
<p>
Docker is a tool that allows us to create and manage virtual machines.
However the virtual machines created by Docker are lightweight, they
use much less resources than the traditional virtual machines. This
comes from the fact that the virtual machines created by Docker can
share resources with the hosting system and between each-other. For
example, all the Docker virtual machines use the same kernel as the
hosting system, no need to use extra resources for running a separate
kernel for each virtual machine. Also, there are no limitations on the
amount of RAM that each Docker VM can use. If the hosting system has
2GB of RAM, this amount of RAM is available to all of the VMs and they
share it as needed. If one of the VMs is busy at a certain time and
the other ones are idle, then the one that is busy can go on and use
all the available free RAM, up to 2GB. Also, Docker VMs can easily
share the disk space, if needed, and there are no limits on the amount
of disk space that each one of them can use.
</p>

<p>
This ability of Docker for sharing resources among the virtual
machines provides a better and more efficient resource utilization.
So, Docker virtual machines can provide both isolation between
different applications, so that they are not affected by the
dependencies of each-other, and efficient utilization of the available
resources. As such, they are a perfect solution in many situations.
One of these situations is also our case of running several webservers
separated from each-other.
</p>

<p>
Besides all these, Docker VMs are also very easy to install and manage
and have full support for scripting and automation, making the life
easy for sysadmins. They are also highly configurable and resource
sharing among virtual machines can be made as restrictive or as
flexible as needed.

<div id="outline-container-orgheadline6" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgheadline6"><span class="section-number-2">6</span> Implementing the Docker solution: WSProxy</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-6">
<p>
I have developed some scripts that automate the process of building
and maintaining a web server proxy with Docker. It is quite simple and
easy to install and to build a Docker container that does the job of a
web server proxy:
</p>
<pre class="example">
mkdir -p /opt/src
cd /opt/src/
git clone https://github.com/docker-build/wsproxy

mkdir -p /opt/workdir/wsproxy1
cd /opt/workdir/wsproxy1
ln -s /opt/src/wsproxy .

cp wsproxy/utils/config.sh .
vim config.sh

wsproxy/docker/build.sh
wsproxy/docker/create.sh

wsproxy/docker/start.sh
</pre>

<p>
So, we first get the code of the scripts from GitHub and save it on
<code>/opt/src/wsproxy</code>. Then we create a new directory for managing the
container, called <code>/opt/workdir/wsproxy1</code> and link the source
directory inside it. Then we copy and tweak the configuration file,
build the docker image, create the docker container, and then start
it.
</p>

<p>
Now let's say that we have two webservers, <i>webserver-1</i> and
<i>webserver-2</i>, each one running in a docker container. Later we will
see in more details how to create and start such webservers, but for
the time being let's say that they are created like this:
</p>
<pre class="example">
docker run -d --name=ws1 --hostname=site1.example.org webserver-1
docker run -d --name=ws2 --hostname=site2.example.org webserver-2
</pre>

<p>
Note that no HTTP ports are exposed to the host (for example using
options <code>-p 80:80 -p 443:443</code>), and this is important because the HTTP
ports are already being used by the <i>wsproxy</i> container.
</p>

<p>
Now we can fix the configuration of <i>wsproxy</i> so that it can serve
as a proxy for these domains, and we can do it like this:
</p>
<pre class="example">
wsproxy/domains-add.sh ws1 site1.example.org
wsproxy/domains-add.sh ws2 site2.example.org site3.example.org
</pre>

<p>
So, all the needed configurations are done by the script
<code>domains-add.sh</code> and we pass it as parameters the name of the
container that actually serves the domain and the name of the
domain. A container can also serve more than one domain, like <i>ws2</i>
which is serving the domains <code>site2.example.org</code> and
<code>site3.example.org</code> (it can do it using the name-based virtual hosting
of apache2, for example).
</p>

<p>
Now all the websites are served from the same server, but they are
isolated from each-other using docker containers, which make an
efficient usage of the server resources and are easy to maintain.
</p>
</div>
</div>


<div id="outline-container-orgheadline7" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgheadline7"><span class="section-number-2">7</span> WSProxy: Serving a Remote Domain Through an SSH-Tunnel</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-7">
<p>
The web server proxy can also serve a domain that is installed on an
other machine. For example, let's say that the domain
<i>site4.example.org</i> is installed on another hosting server, which does
not have a public IP. Then we can use this command to tell <i>wsproxy</i>
to serve this domain as well:
</p>
<pre class="example">
wsproxy/sshtunnel-add.sh site4.example.org
</pre>

<p>
This command will adjust the configuration of <i>wsproxy</i> to serve this
domain and it will also create the script
<code>sshtunnel-keys/site4.example.org.sh</code>.  The script
<code>site4.example.org.sh</code> should be transferred to the server where this
domain is hosted and executed there. Once it is executed for the first
time, it will set up the remote server to connect to <i>wsproxy</i> and
establish a ssh tunnel.  The web server proxy can use this tunnel to
forward http(s) requests to the webserver. The scripts that are
installed on the webserver try also to test periodically the
established ssh tunnel and to re-establish it if broken.
</p>
</div>
</div>


<div id="outline-container-orgheadline8" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgheadline8"><span class="section-number-2">8</span> WSProxy: Managing the HTTPS Certificates</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-8">
<p>
The scripts of <i>wsproxy</i> can also obtain free SSL certificates from letsencrypt
for the managed domains. It is as simple as this:
</p>
<pre class="example">
wsproxy/get-ssl-cert.sh user@gmail.com site1.example.org --test
wsproxy/get-ssl-cert.sh user@gmail.com site1.example.org
wsproxy/get-ssl-cert.sh user@gmail.com site2.example.org site3.example.org -t
wsproxy/get-ssl-cert.sh user@gmail.com site2.example.org site3.example.org
</pre>

<p>
In the first command we run the script in testing mode, to make sure
that everything works as expected. Then we remove the testing option
and get the certificate for the domain <i>site1.example.org</i>. The last
two commands are the same, but it shows that we can actually use the
same certificate for several domains. The email provided is that of
the maintainer of <i>wsproxy</i>. When the certificates are about to
expire, letsencrypt will send a warning to this email address so that
the certificates are renewed in time. However the script
<code>get-ssl-cert.sh</code> takes care to set up automatic renewal of the
certificates, so normally no manual intervention is needed in order to
renew them, unless something is wrong.
</p>
</div>
</div>


<div id="outline-container-orgheadline9" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgheadline9"><span class="section-number-2">9</span> Case Study 1: Installing Moodle</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-9">
<p>
Moodle is a powerful learning platform that can be useful for
universities and schools. It is not difficult to install it on a web
server, however I have built some scripts for installing it in a
Docker container, which make its installation and configuration even
easier. They can be used like this:
</p>
<pre class="example">
mkdir -p /opt/src/
cd /opt/src/
git clone https://github.com/docker-build/moodle

mkdir -p /opt/workdir/moodle1.example.org
cd /opt/workdir/moodle1.example.org/

ln -s /opt/src/moodle .
cp moodle/utils/settings.sh .
vim settings.sh

moodle/docker/build.sh
moodle/docker/create.sh
moodle/docker/start.sh
moodle/config.sh
</pre>

<p>
First we get the code of the scripts from GitHub and save it on
<code>/opt/src/moodle</code>. Then we create a new directory for managing the
container, called <code>/opt/workdir/moodle1.example.org</code> and link the
source directory inside it. Then we copy and tweek the file
<code>settings.sh</code>.  Then we build the docker image, create the docker
container and start and configure it.
</p>

<p>
The file <code>settings.sh</code> should look like this:
</p>
<pre class="example">
### Docker settings.
IMAGE=moodle
CONTAINER=moodle1-example-org
#PORT_HTTP=80
#PORT_HTTPS=443
#PORT_SSH=2222

DOMAIN="moodle1.example.org"
[ . . . . . ]
</pre>

<p>
Notice that the http ports are commented out, so that the container
does not expose them. If this was a standalone installation then
normally we would expose these ports. However we are running
<i>moodle1-example-org</i> behind the <i>wsproxy</i>, so the http requests
should come from <i>wsproxy</i>. To tell <i>wsproxy</i> to forward the http
requests for this domain to the right container, we use these
commands:
</p>
<pre class="example">
cd /opt/workdir/wsproxy1/
wsproxy/domains-add.sh moodle1-example-org moodle1.example.org
</pre>

<p>
And while we are here, we also tell <i>wsproxy</i> to get and manage
a free "letsencrypt" SSL certificate for this domain:
</p>
<pre class="example">
wsproxy/get-ssl-cert.sh user@gmail.com moodle1.example.org -t
wsproxy/get-ssl-cert.sh user@gmail.com moodle1.example.org
</pre>

<p>

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-10">
<p>
This is a tool that allows shell access to a server using a browser as
a terminal.  I use it to provide a shell access to my Linux students,
so that they can try the commands, do the homeworks, etc. Installing
it in a docker container is very easy and similar to the installation
of Moodle:
</p>
<pre class="example">
mkdir -p /opt/src/
cd /opt/src/
git clone https://github.com/docker-build/shellinabox

mkdir -p /opt/workdir/shell1.example.org
cd /opt/workdir/shell1.example.org
ln -s /opt/src/shellinabox .

cp shellinabox/utils/settings.sh .
vim settings.sh
cp shellinabox/utils/accounts.txt .
vim accounts.txt

shellinabox/docker/build.sh
shellinabox/docker/create.sh
shellinabox/docker/start.sh
shellinabox/config.sh
</pre>

<p>
The file <code>settings.sh</code> should look like this:
</p>
<pre class="example">
### Docker settings.
IMAGE=shellinabox
CONTAINER=shell1-example-org
PORT=
</pre>
<p>
Again, we leave the port empty because we don't any ports to be
exposed by the container, since it is running behind the <i>wsproxy</i>.
To let <i>wsproxy</i> know about handling this domain we use these
commands:
</p>
<pre class="example">
cd /opt/workdir/wsproxy1/
wsproxy/domains-add.sh shell1-example-org shell1.example.org

wsproxy/get-ssl-cert.sh user@gmail.com shell1.example.org -t
wsproxy/get-ssl-cert.sh user@gmail.com shell1.example.org
</pre>

<p>
And now we can open in browser: <a href="https://shell1.example.org/">https://shell1.example.org/</a>

<h2 id="orgheadline11"><span class="section-number-2">11</span> Case Study 3: Installing SchoolTool</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-11">
<p>
SchoolTool is a web based student information system. Installing it is
quite easy and similar to the applications that we have seen above:
</p>
<pre class="example">
mkdir -p /opt/src/
cd /opt/src/
git clone https://github.com/docker-build/SchoolTool

mkdir -p /opt/workdir/school1.example.org
cd /opt/workdir/school1.example.org/
ln -s /opt/src/SchoolTool .

cp SchoolTool/utils/settings.sh .
vim settings.sh

SchoolTool/docker/build.sh
SchoolTool/docker/create.sh
SchoolTool/docker/start.sh
SchoolTool/config.sh
</pre>

<p>
The configuration file <code>settings.sh</code> looks like this:
</p>
<pre class="example">
### docker image and container
IMAGE=schooltool
CONTAINER=school1-example-org
PORTS=

### domain of the site
DOMAIN="school1.example.org"
[ . . . . . ]
</pre>
<p>
Here again we leave the PORTS empty because we don't want the
container to expose the http ports. To let <i>wsproxy</i> know about
handling this domain we use these commands:
</p>
<pre class="example">
cd /opt/workdir/wsproxy1/
wsproxy/domains-add.sh school1-example-org school1.example.org

wsproxy/get-ssl-cert.sh user@gmail.com school1.example.org -t
wsproxy/get-ssl-cert.sh user@gmail.com school1.example.org
</pre>

<p>
The latest stable version of SchoolTool depends on <i>ubuntu-14.04</i>,
while the rest of the applications that we have seen depend on
<i>ubuntu-16.04</i>.  This makes it impossible to install it on the same
server with the others, unless virtual machines or Docker are
used. This illustrates again the advantage of using <i>wsproxy</i> and
docker containers for installing all the applications on the same
server.

<h2 id="orgheadline12"><span class="section-number-2">12</span> Managing Your Own Domain Name Server</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-12">
<p>
The sites or webapps that we have installed on our server each one has
its own domain or subdomain. Nowadays domains and subdomains are
managed by service providers and everything is done from a nice web
interface. However we will see in this section that it is not
difficult to manage our domains with our server. But of course you
need to know first some basic concepts about how DNS works.
</p>

<p>
I have also built some scripts that make it even easier. These scripts
install <b>bind9</b> inside a docker container and configure it as a
<b>hidden</b>, <b>master</b>, <b>authoritative-only</b> DNS server.
</p>

<p>
<b>Hidden</b> means that it stays behind a firewall, not accessible from
the outside world. <b>Master</b> or <b>primary</b> means that it is a primary
source of information for the domains that it provides. There are also
<b>slave/secondary</b> DNS servers, which get the information of the
domains that they cover from other (master/primary) servers. If we
update the domain on a master server, the slaves will synchronize with
it automatically after a certain time.
</p>

<p>
<b>Authoritative-only</b> means that the server will just give answers for
the domains that it masters, and nothing else. DNS servers can
possibly do several things, for example give answers to DNS requests
from clients, both for the domains that they are responsible for and
for other domains. If they don’t know the answer, they get it from the
Internet, fetch it to the client and then cache it for future
requests. However this server does not do any of these things. It just
answers for its own domains.
</p>

<p>
But there is a catch here: if the server stays behind the firewall,
hidden from the world and does not accept any requests from clients,
where should the clients send queries about our domain? The answer is
that they will query some slave/secondary DNS servers which are
synchronized with our server. Fortunately there are lots of free
secondary DNS services out there:
<a href="http://networking.ringofsaturn.com/Unix/freednsservers.php">http://networking.ringofsaturn.com/Unix/freednsservers.php</a>
</p>

<p>
Before continuing with the rest of installation/configuration,
register your domain(s) on two or more secondary servers.  For example
I have used <i>puck.nether.net</i> and <i>buddyns.com</i>.
</p>

<p>
Next get the scripts:
</p>
<pre class="example">
cd /opt/workdir/
git clone https://github.com/docker-build/bind9
cd bind9/
</pre>

<p>
Then modify <code>config/etc/bind/named.conf.local</code> to look like this:
</p>
<pre class="example">
zone "example.org" {
        type master;
        also-notify {
                173.244.206.26;     # a.transfer.buddyns.com
                88.198.106.11;      # b.transfer.buddyns.com
                204.42.254.5;       # puck.nether.net
        };
        file "/var/cache/bind/db.example.org";
};
</pre>
<p>
Of course, you can use some slave DNS servers different from
<i>buddyns.com</i> and <i>puck.nether.net</i> (and the corresponding IPs). Fix
the IPs of the slave DNS servers also on
<code>config/etc/bind/named.conf.options</code> and on <code>ufw.sh</code>.
</p>

<p>
Now create a file like <code>config/var/cache/bind/db.example.org</code> with a
content like this:
#+begin_example
; example.org
$TTL    24h
$ORIGIN example.org.
@       1D      IN      SOA     ns1.example.org.    admin.example.org. (
                                        2017063001 ; serial
                                        3H ; refresh
                                        15m ; retry
                                        1w ; expire
                                        2h ; minimum
                                )
                IN      NS              b.ns.buddyns.com.
                IN      NS              c.ns.buddyns.com.
                IN      NS              puck.nether.net.
</p>

<p>
IN      MX      10      aspmx.l.google.com.
</p>

<p>
; server host definitions
ns1.example.org.  IN  A                 12.345.67.89
@               IN      A               12.345.67.89
</p>

<p>
; point to the server any subdomain
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-orgheadline13" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgheadline13"><span class="section-number-2">13</span> IN      A               12.345.67.89</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-13">
<p>
mail            IN      CNAME           ghs.google.com.
#+end_example
</p>

<p>
You can see that only the secondary servers are listed as nameservers
for our domain. So, when clients have any questions about our domain,
they go and ask them, not our server (which is behind a firewall and
cannot be reached). Also don’t forget to change the serial number whenever
this file is modified, otherwise the changes may not be noticed and
propagated on the Internet.
</p>

<p>
For managing another domain, we should add another zone at
<code>config/etc/bind/named.conf.local</code> and another db file at
<code>config/var/cache/bind/</code>.
</p>

<p>
Once we are done with the config files, we can give <code>./build.sh</code> and
<code>./run.sh</code> and the <i>bind9</i> container will be up and running. In case
that configuration files need to be changed, update them and rebuild
the container by running: <code>./rm.sh &amp;&amp; ./build.sh &amp;&amp; ./run.sh</code>
</p>

<h2 id="orgheadline14"><span class="section-number-2">14</span> Conclusion</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-14">
<p>
We have seen that it is quite possible to install several websites,
webapps etc. in the same server. Using Docker makes it more efficient,
more robust and easier to install and maintain them. This is due to
the nice features of Docker, like having a small overhead, sharing
resources, flexibility in configuration, being scriptable etc. We have
also seen that using a bunch of small shell scripts with Docker goes a
long way towards making the installation and maintenance of such a
server very easy.
