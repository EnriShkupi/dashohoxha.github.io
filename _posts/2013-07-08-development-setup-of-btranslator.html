B-Translator helps to get feedback about <i>l10n</i> (translations of the
programs). It tries to collect very small translation contributions
from a wide crowd of people and to dilute them into something useful.
It is developed as a Drupal7 profile and the <a href="https://github.com/B-Translator">code</a> is hosted on GitHub.
Here I describe the development setup and process that I use for this
project. Most of the the tips are project specific, however some of
them can be used on any Drupal project.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-sec-1" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-1"><span class="section-number-2">1</span> Installation</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
Installation for development is the same as the installation for a
production server, inside a chroot. The steps are like this:
</p>
<pre class="example">
mkdir /var/chroot
cd /var/chroot/
git clone https://github.com/dashohoxha/B-Translator.git
nohup nice B-Translator/install/install.sh btr &amp;
tail -f nohup.out
chroot btr/ /tmp/install/config.sh
chroot btr/ rm -rf /tmp/install
reboot  ## it is advisable to reboot the host after this installation
</pre>
</div>
</div>


<div id="outline-container-sec-2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-2"><span class="section-number-2">2</span> Changing the webserver</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
The webserver that is used for production is NGINX because it is
more responsive in high load, has build in cache, etc. The
configuration of NGINX is also tweaked for production (has DoS
protection, short timeout, etc.) For development Apache2 can be more
suitable. It can be started and stopped like this:
</p>
<pre class="example">
chroot /var/chroot/btr/
/var/www/btranslator/profiles/btranslator/dev/apache2.sh start
/var/www/btranslator/profiles/btranslator/dev/apache2.sh stop
</pre>

<p>
<b>Important:</b> When <i>apache2</i> is started, the services <i>nginx</i>,
<i>memcached</i> and <i>php5-fpm</i> are stopped. Don't forget to modify the
init script <code>/etc/init.d/chroot-btr</code> like this:
</p>
<pre class="example">
#CHROOT_SERVICES="cron php5-fpm memcached mysql nginx"
CHROOT_SERVICES="cron mysql apache2"
</pre>
<p>
The script <code>apache2.sh</code> cannot make this modification automatically
because it runs inside the chroot, and the init script is outside
the chroot (on the host system). So it has to be done manually.
</p>

<p>
I also add something like this on <b>/etc/hosts</b>, so that I can access
it on the browser with a domain name:
</p>
<pre class="example">
127.0.1.1  l10n.org.xx dev.l10n.org.xx
</pre>
<p>
This modification has to be done manually as well.
</p>
</div>
</div>


<div id="outline-container-sec-3" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-3"><span class="section-number-2">3</span> Re-installing the application</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
It can be done with the script <code>dev/install.sh</code>:
</p>
<pre class="example">
chroot /var/chroot/btr/
/var/www/btranslator/profiles/btranslator/dev/reinstall.sh
</pre>
<p>
It will rebuild the Drupal directory with <b>drush make</b> and install
the btranslator profile with <b>drush site-install</b>, and then do all
the rest of configurations just like they are done during
installation.
</p>

<p>
Normally there is no need to reinstall the application, unless we
want to test the installation profile and the installation scripts.
</p>

<p>
Another kind of re-installation, which touches only the database of
Drupal (btranslator) and nothing else, can be done with the script
<code>dev/install.sh</code>:
</p>
<pre class="example">
chroot /var/chroot/btr/
/var/www/btranslator/profiles/btranslator/dev/reinstall-db.sh
</pre>

<p>
It is useful for testing the features. Usually, when features are
un-installed, things are not undone properly. In order to leave out
a feature, it should not be installed since the beginning. So, it is
important to test different combinations of them to see which one
works better for us.
</p>
</div>
</div>


<div id="outline-container-sec-4" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-4"><span class="section-number-2">4</span> Making a clone for development</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">
<p>
Inside the chroot I make a clone for development like this:
</p>
<pre class="example">
chroot /var/chroot/btr/
cd /var/www/btranslator/profiles/btranslator/
dev/clone.sh dev
</pre>

<p>
It creates a new application with root <b><i>var/www/btranslator_dev</i></b>
and with DB named <b>btranslator_dev</b>. It also creates the drush alias
<b>@dev</b>, and modifies the configuration of the webserver so that the
cloned application can be accessed at <b>dev.l10n.org.xx</b>.
</p>

<p>
<b>Caution:</b> The root directory and the DB of the clone will be
erased, if they exist.
</p>

<p>
Other clones like this can be created for testing etc. To cleanup
(remove/erase) a clone, we can use <b>clone_rm.sh</b> like this:
</p>
<pre class="example">
chroot /var/chroot/btr/
cd /var/www/btranslator/profiles/btranslator/
dev/clone_rm.sh dev
</pre>

<p>
By the way, we can also modify a little bit the configuration of a
development copy of the application (in order to help us not confuse
a development copy with a live or testing one), with the script <code>dev/config.php</code>:
</p>
<pre class="example">
chroot /var/chroot/btr/
cd /var/www/
drush php-script btranslator/profiles/btranslator/config.php dev1
drush @dev php-script btranslator/profiles/btranslator/config.php dev2
</pre>

<p>
It will set site_name to 'B-Translator (dev1)', will make site email
something like 'user+dev1@gmail.com', will enable email re-routing,
display the <i>devel</i> menu on the footer region, etc. It is not
required, but sometimes may be useful.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-5" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-5"><span class="section-number-2">5</span> Making a backup of the application</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-5">
<p>
Sometimes, when testing things on Drupal (installing/uninstalling
modules etc.) things get messy and it is not possible anymore to
revert to the state that you were before starting the test. In this
case the only way to get safely to a previous stable state is by
restoring a backup (or installing from the scratch and repeating all
the configurations).
</p>

<p>
A snapshot of the application is just like a full backup with a time
stamp. It saves the state of the application at a certain time, both
the code (the whole Drupal directory) and the database. It can be
done like this:
</p>
<pre class="example">
chroot /var/chroot/btr/
cd /var/www/
ln -s btranslator_dev/profiles/btranslator/ B-Translator

B-Translator/dev/snapshot.sh make
B-Translator/dev/snapshot.sh make @dev
</pre>
<p>
These will create the files <code>snapshot-btranslator-20130602.tgz</code>
and <code>snapshot-btranslator_dev-20130602.tgz</code>. They can be restored
like this:
</p>
<pre class="example">
B-Translator/dev/snapshot.sh restore --file=snapshot-btranslator-20130602.tgz
B-Translator/dev/snapshot.sh restore --file=snapshot-btranslator_dev-20130602.tgz
B-Translator/dev/snapshot.sh restore @dev --file=snapshot-btranslator-20130602.tgz
B-Translator/dev/snapshot.sh restore @dev --file=snapshot-btranslator_dev-20130602.tgz
</pre>
<p>
As you may notice, a snapshot of @dev can also be restored on the
main application, and the other way around.
</p>

<p>
However, in many cases a backup/restore of the database is all that
is needed, and it is more efficient. It can be done with <b>drush
sql-dump</b> and <b>drush sql-query</b> like this:
</p>
<pre class="example">
drush sql-dump &gt; btranslator.sql
drush sql-dump @dev &gt; btranslator_dev.sql

drush sql-query --file=$(pwd)/btranslator.sql
drush sql-query --file=$(pwd)/btranslator_dev.sql

drush @dev sql-query --file=$(pwd)/btranslator.sql
drush @dev sql-query --file=$(pwd)/btranslator_dev.sql
</pre>
</div>
</div>


<div id="outline-container-sec-6" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-6"><span class="section-number-2">6</span> Accessing the code of the application from outside chroot</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-6">
<p>
In order to access easily the code of the application from outside
chroot, I create a symbolic link like this:
</p>
<pre class="example">
cd /var/chroot/
ln -s btr/var/www/btranslator_dev/profiles/btranslator/ \
      dev
</pre>

<p>
Now I can go to <b><i>var/chroot/dev</i></b> and start <i>emacs</i> or any other
tools. This way I don't have to install <i>emacs</i> or any other
development tools inside the <i>chroot</i> and can use the best of
development tools that my host environment can offer me.
</p>
</div>
</div>


<div id="outline-container-sec-7" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-7"><span class="section-number-2">7</span> Pushing commits to github</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-7">
<p>
The copy of the application on
<code>/var/www/btranslator_dev/profiles/btranslator/</code> (as well as the one
on <code>/var/www/btranslator/profiles/btranslator/</code>) are actually clones
of the git repository at <a href="https://github.com/dashohoxha/B-Translator">https://github.com/dashohoxha/B-Translator</a>
so we can <b>pull</b> from it and <b>push</b> to it. Pulling (to get
up-to-date) can be done by everybody, however pushing requires a
username and password (the ones that are used to access the account
at GitHub).
</p>
</div>
</div>


<div id="outline-container-sec-8" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-8"><span class="section-number-2">8</span> The commit workflow</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-8">
<p>
For small or straight-forward changes I can also work directly on
the <b>master</b> branch, then <b>commit</b>, and then <b>push</b> to github.
</p>

<p>
However I usually use a bit more complicated workflow. First I
create and checkout a <b>dev</b> branch. When the work is done I merge
this branch to <b>master</b> and then delete it. Finally <b>push</b> the
commit(s) to github.
</p>
<pre class="example">
git checkout -d dev     ### create a branch and switch to it
[work-commit-work-comit]
git checkout master     ### switch back to master
git pull                ### get any latest commits from github
git merge dev [--squash]
git push                ### send commits to github
git branch -D dev       ### erase the branch
</pre>

<p>
Usually there are no commits comming from github, since I am
the only developper (unless I have worked and commited from some
other location). So, when I merge without <b>&#x2013;squash</b> this usually
results in <b>fast-forward</b> merge, which means that all the
commits that I have done on the branch <b>dev</b> are automatically
transferred to the branch <b>master</b>.
</p>

<p>
However sometimes there may be <i>dirty commits</i> on the <b>dev</b> branch,
which means that there may be incomplete commits, or commits that
reverse what was done on the previous commits etc. When I wish to
reorganise commits and make them cleaner, I use the <b>&#x2013;squash</b>
option, which collects all the changes on the <b>dev</b> branch and
leaves them on the <b>master</b> sandbox as local modifications
(uncommitted). Then I can redo the commits on a cleaner or more
logical way. Afterwards the <b>dev</b> branch will be deleted and the old
commits will be lost.
</p>
</div>
</div>


<div id="outline-container-sec-9" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-9"><span class="section-number-2">9</span> Making a local git clone of the dev application</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-9">
<p>
Sometimes it is not easy or suitable to test modifications on the
<b>@dev</b> application (<code>/var/www/btranslator_dev</code>). For example this is
the case when I have to test install/uninstall, enable/disable
modules, features, etc. In this case I test them on the main
application instance (<code>/var/www/btranslator</code>). Since both
applications are clones of the <a href="https://github.com/dashohoxha/B-Translator">GitHub repository</a>, it is easy to push
commits from <i>btranslator_dev</i> to <i>github</i> and to pull them from
<i>github</i> to <i>btranslator</i>.
</p>

<p>
However, sometimes it is better to test modifications and make sure
that they work, before pushing them to <i>github</i>. This can be done if
the code on <i>btranslator</i> is a git clone of the code on
<i>btranslator_dev</i> (instead of being a clone from <i>github</i>).
</p>

<p>
The script <code>dev/git-clone-dev.sh</code> makes just this. It replaces the
code of <i>btranslator</i> with a git clone of the <b>dev branch</b> from
<i>btranslator_dev</i>. Then the workflow is like this:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Work and commit on the branch <b>dev</b> of <b>btranslator_dev</b>
</li>
<li>Pull on <b>btranslator</b> and test.
</li>
<li>Repeat steps <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> until the modification that we are
making is OK.
</li>
<li>Push changes upwards to github, like this:
<pre class="example">
cd /var/www/btranslator_dev/profiles/btranslator
git checkout master
git merge dev [--squash]
git push
git branch -D dev
git checkout -b dev
</pre>
<p>
So, after merging to <b>master</b> and pushing to <i>github</i>, we delete
the branch <b>dev</b> and create a new one.
</p>
</li>
<li>Make a git pull on <b>btranslator</b> and sync it with <b>btranslator_dev</b>
<pre class="example">
cd /var/www/btranslator/profiles/btranslator
git pull
</pre>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>


<div id="outline-container-sec-10" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-10"><span class="section-number-2">10</span> Working with a dev-test-live workflow</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-10">
<p>
All the work that is described on the sections above is about
development and local testing that is done on a working copy
(sandbox) of a <i>chroot</i> installation. This is usually installed on
my personal machine (that I use for development).
</p>

<p>
At some point, all the modifications have to be transferred to a
public server, where the application is in "production", performing
"live". On that public server there is the same <i>chroot</i> environment
as in the development server. The synchronisation of the application
can be done via git push and pull.
</p>

<p>
However <b>drush rsync</b> and <b>drush sql-sync</b> offer another option for
synchronisation. For more details see:
</p>
<pre class="example">
drush help rsync
drush help sql-sync
drush topic docs-aliases
</pre>

<p>
These commands use drush <b>aliases</b>, which allow also remote
execution of drush commands. On my development environment I have
created the file <code>/etc/drush/remote.aliases.drushrc.php</code>, which has
a content like this:
</p>
<pre class="example">
&lt;?php

$aliases['live'] = array (
  'root' =&gt; '/var/www/btranslator',
  'uri' =&gt; 'http://l10n.org.al',

  'remote-host' =&gt; 'l10n.org.al',
  'remote-user' =&gt; 'root',
  'ssh-options' =&gt; '-p 2201 -i /root/.ssh/id_rsa',

  'path-aliases' =&gt; array (
    '%profile' =&gt; 'profiles/btranslator',
    '%data' =&gt; '/var/www/btranslator_data',
    '%pofiles' =&gt; '/var/www/PO_files',
    '%exports' =&gt; '/var/www/exports',
    '%downloads' =&gt; '/var/www/downloads',
  ),

  'command-specific' =&gt; array (
    'sql-sync' =&gt; array (
      'simulate' =&gt; '1',
    ),
    'rsync' =&gt; array (
      'simulate' =&gt; '1',
    ),
  ),
);

$aliases['test'] = array (
  'parent' =&gt; '@live',
  'root' =&gt; '/var/www/btranslator',
  'uri' =&gt; 'http://www2.l10n.org.al',
  'remote-host' =&gt; 'www2.l10n.org.al',

  'command-specific' =&gt; array (
    'sql-sync' =&gt; array (
      'simulate' =&gt; '0',
    ),
    'rsync' =&gt; array (
      'simulate' =&gt; '0',
    ),
  ),
);
</pre>

<p>
It defines the aliases <b>live</b> and <b>test</b>. The test/stage application
is almost identical to the live/production one, however it is not
for public use. The idea is to test there first any updates/upgrades
of the application, in order to make sure that they don't break any
things, before applying them to the real live application. In my case
it is placed on a different server, however it can also be placed on
the same server as the live application (just make a clone of the main
application with <code>dev/clone.sh test</code>).
</p>

<p>
When everything is set up correctly, the synchronisation can be done
as simply as this:
</p>
<pre class="example">
drush rsync @live @test
drush sql-sync @live @test
drush rsync @live @dev
drush sql-sync @live @dev
</pre>

<p>
<b>Note:</b> Synchronising this way from <b>@test</b> to <b>@live</b> or from
<b>@dev</b> to <b>@live</b>, usually is a HUGE mistake, but the <i>simulate</i>
option on the config file will make sure that it fails.
</p>

<p>
For drush commands to work remotely, <b>ssh</b> daemon has to be running
on the remote server, inside the chroot environment. By default it
is not installed, but it can be installed with the script
<b>dev/install-sshd.sh</b>. This script will also take care to change the
ssh port to <b>2201</b>, in order to avoid any conflicts with any
existing daemon on the host environment, and also for increased
security.
</p>

<p>
For remote access to work correctly, the public/private key ssh
access should be set up and configured as well. For more detailed
instructions on how to do it see:
