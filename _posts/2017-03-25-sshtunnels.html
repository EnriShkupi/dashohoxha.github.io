summary: The Secure SHell (ssh) is normally used for remote login to
    another system.  However it is a flexible and powerful tool that
    can be used for many other interesting things as well. One of them
    is port forwarding (also known as ssh tunneling) between the
    client and the server machine. Althought there are lots of
    tutorials out there, I always find it a bit confusing how to use
    it properly. So, I am writting yet another tutorial about ssh tunneling,
    based on use cases and examples, hoping to make its usage clear
    to myself and to the others.

The Secure SHell (ssh) is normally used for remote login to another
system.  However it is a flexible and powerful tool that can be used
for many other interesting things as well. One of them is port
forwarding (also known as ssh tunneling) between the client and the
server machine. Althought there are lots of tutorials out there, I
always find it a bit confusing how to use it properly. So, I am
writting yet another tutorial about ssh tunneling, based on use cases
and examples, hoping to make its usage clear to myself and to the
others.
</p>


<div id="outline-container-orgheadline1" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgheadline1"><span class="section-number-2">1</span> Bypass a firewall blocking</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
Suppose that a certain website (for example twitter.com, or in our
example <code>remote.com</code>) is blocked by a firewall, which does not allow
us to open it in browser. Let's also say that we have <b>ssh</b> access to
a server (that I will call <code>proxy.com</code>) somewhere on the internet, on
the other side of the firewall. This means that we can login to this
server with a command like <code>ssh user@proxy.com</code> (and with the user's
password). In such a situation we can bypass the firewall with a
command like this:
</p>
<pre class="example">
ssh user@proxy.com -L 8000:remote.com:80
</pre>

<p>
This situation is presented in the following diagram:
</p>


<div id="orgparagraph1" class="figure">
<p><a href="/images/sshtunnels/sshtunnel1.png"><img src="/images/sshtunnels/sshtunnel1.png" alt="sshtunnel1.png" /></a>
</p>
<p><span class="figure-number">Figure 1:</span> Bypassing a firewall block.</p>
</div>

<p>
In this case we are forwarding the port <code>8000</code> on our local machine to
the port <code>80</code> on the server <code>remote.com</code>, through the server
<code>proxy.com</code>.  This means that if we open <code>127.0.0.1:8000</code> in browser,
this request will be sent to <code>remote.com:80</code> through <code>proxy.com</code> and
we will get the reply in the browser.
</p>

<p>
As far as <code>remote.com</code> is concerned, the request seems to come from
<code>proxy.com</code>. The firewall (which blocks the website <code>remote.com</code>) sees
only <b>ssh</b> traffic between our machine and <code>proxy.com</code>. It has no clue
about the HTTP traffic because it is encapsulated inside the SSH
traffic, and the SSH communication is encrypted.
</p>

<p>
You can see why it is called a <b>tunnel</b>: because the traffic is hidden
inside the SSH traffic, and because it can be used to bypass the
network gatekeepers and checkpoints.
</p>

<p>
<b>Note:</b> The situation when a webside is blocked can be solved by other
means as well, for example using a <a href="https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en">Tor browser</a>. However it serves as a
good example for explaining ssh tunneling and how it works.
</p>
</div>
</div>


<div id="outline-container-orgheadline2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgheadline2"><span class="section-number-2">2</span> Connect to a database behind a firewall</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
Suppose that we have a webserver and a database server on the remote
server <code>example.com</code>. Usually a database is configured to be accessed
only from the localhost, but we would like to access it remotely from
our local machine (in order to use a GUI management tool, for
example). We can solve this situation by making a SSH port forwarding
with a command like this:
</p>
<pre class="example">
ssh user@example.com -L 9000:localhost:3306
</pre>

<p>
This situation is presented in the following diagram:
</p>


<div id="orgparagraph2" class="figure">
<p><a href="/images/sshtunnels/sshtunnel1.png"><img src="/images/sshtunnels/sshtunnel2.png" alt="sshtunnel2.png" /></a>
</p>
<p><span class="figure-number">Figure 2:</span> Connect to a DB behind a firewall</p>
</div>

<p>
Now we can use the pot <code>9000</code> on our local machine to connect to the
database server.  Behind the scene it will be actually forwarded to
the port <code>3306</code> on the server <code>example.com</code>. As an added benefit, the
communication be encrypted and secure, even if the database server
itself does not support secure communication, because all the traffic
is encapsulated inside the SSH protocol.
</p>

<p>
About the option <code>-L 9000:localhost:3306</code>, here <code>localhost</code> means the
local host <i>after we have logged in</i> to the server <code>example.com</code>.  So,
it actually referes to the server <code>example.com</code>, not to our local
machine.  Since we are using the option <code>-L</code>, then the port <code>9000</code> in
our local machine is forwarded to the port <code>3306</code> on the remote
machine (in this case <code>example.com</code> itself).
</p>

<p>
One way of thinking about it is that with the option <code>-L</code> the port
forwarding is in the same direction as the ssh connection itself: from
our local machine to the remote server. In the next section we will
see the option <code>-R</code> which makes the port forwarding in the reverse
direction compared to the ssh connection.
</p>
</div>
</div>


<div id="outline-container-orgheadline3" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgheadline3"><span class="section-number-2">3</span> Access a local machine from internet</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
Suppose that we are developing a Ruby-on-Rails application in our
local machine and we want to show it to someone else on the internet.
Normally this is not possible because our machine does not have a
public IP that can be accessed remotely. However we can fix this if we
have ssh access to a server with public IP, somewhere on the cloud.
We can use a ssh command like this:
</p>
<pre class="example">
ssh user@example.com -R 9000:localhost:3000
</pre>

<p>
This situation is presented in the following diagram:
</p>


<div id="orgparagraph3" class="figure">
<p><a href="/images/sshtunnels/sshtunnel1.png"><img src="/images/sshtunnels/sshtunnel3.png" alt="sshtunnel3.png" /></a>
</p>
<p><span class="figure-number">Figure 3:</span> Accessing a local machine from internet.</p>
</div>

<p>
Since the option <code>-R</code> is used, port forwarding is in the reverse
direction of the ssh connection, which means from the remote server to
the local machine. Hence, <code>9000</code> is the port on <code>example.com</code> and
<code>3000</code> is the port on our local machine. The result of this port
forwarding is that whenever somebody tries to connect to
<code>example.com:9000</code> they will actually be connected to <code>127.0.0.1:3000</code>
on our local machine.
</p>

<p>
<b>Note:</b> In order for the reverse port forwarding to work, it has to be
enabled on the <b>sshd</b> configuration of <code>example.com</code>. It is not
enabled by default because it may become a security problem. To enable
it we have to add the line <code>GatewayPorts yes</code> on
<code>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</code>, and then we have to restart the sshd service:
<code>service sshd restart</code>.
</p>
</div>
</div>


<div id="outline-container-orgheadline4" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgheadline4"><span class="section-number-2">4</span> Connect two computers with private IPs</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">
<p>
The following diagram shows the connection between two computers with
private IPs, with the help of a proxy server that has a public IP:
</p>


<div id="orgparagraph4" class="figure">
<p><a href="/images/sshtunnels/sshtunnel1.png"><img src="/images/sshtunnels/sshtunnel4.png" alt="sshtunnel4.png" /></a>
</p>
<p><span class="figure-number">Figure 4:</span> Connecting two computers with private IPs</p>
</div>

<p>
Since none of the local computers has a public IP (and usually each of
them is behind a firewall) they cannot contact each-other
directly. However, with the help of a proxy server which is accessible
from both of them, they can establish a port forwarding between them
and communicate securely.
</p>

<p>
The first local computer can forward its local port <code>5901</code> to the port
<code>5933</code> on <code>proxy.com</code>, like this:
</p>
<pre class="example">
ssh user@proxy.com -L 5901:localhost:5933
</pre>
<p>
Then the second local computer can forward the port <code>5933</code> on <code>proxy.com</code>
to its local port <code>5901</code>, like this:
</p>
<pre class="example">
ssh user@proxy.com -R 5933:localhost:5901
</pre>
<p>
The net effect of of these two connections is that the port <code>5901</code> of
the first local host is forwarded to the port <code>5901</code> of the second
host, and when an application tries to connect to port <code>5901</code> on the
first machine it will actually be connected to the port <code>5901</code> of the
second machine.
</p>

<p>
By the way, the port <code>5901</code> is usually use by VNC, and this connection
enables a vnc client on the first machine to access a vnc server on
the second machine. It has the added benefit of a secure connection,
because the VNC protocol is a bit old and does not support encryption,
but the traffic is done inside a ssh tunnel, and this makes it secure.
</p>

<p>
Any other protocol can be tunneled, instead of the VNC protocol. It
is perfectly possible to tunnel the SSH protocol as well, inside a ssh tunnel.
For example, if we run these commands:
</p>
<pre class="example">
(1)  ssh user@proxy.com -L 22:localhost:5327
(2)  ssh user@proxy.com -R 5327:localhost:22
</pre>
<p>
Then by running the command <code>ssh abc@127.0.0.1</code> on the first machine,
we will be able to access the account <code>abc</code> on the second
machine. This assumes that we don't have a <code>sshd</code> server running on
port <code>22</code> on the first machine, otherwise we would have a port
conflict. But in such a case we could forward the port <code>2201</code> (for
example) to port <code>22</code> and then access it like this: <code>ssh -p 2201
abc@127.0.0.1</code>.
</p>
</div>
</div>


<div id="outline-container-orgheadline5" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgheadline5"><span class="section-number-2">5</span> Accessing a local computer on a remote LAN</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-5">
<p>
It is also possible to use the second machine as a gateway for accessing
another local computer on its LAN, as shown in this diagram:
</p>


<div id="orgparagraph5" class="figure">
<p><a href="/images/sshtunnels/sshtunnel1.png"><img src="/images/sshtunnels/sshtunnel5.png" alt="sshtunnel5.png" /></a>
</p>
<p><span class="figure-number">Figure 5:</span> Accessing a local computer on a remote LAN.</p>
</div>

<p>
The commands in this case are like this:
</p>
<pre class="example">
(1)  ssh user@proxy.com -L 2201:localhost:5327
(2)  ssh user@proxy.com -R 5327:local3:22
</pre>

<p>
On the second command we can give the name or the IP of the internal
machine that we want to expose. Then we can connect to it from the first
machine with a command like this: <code>ssh -p 2201 abc@127.0.0.1</code>.
</p>
</div>
</div>


<div id="outline-container-orgheadline6" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgheadline6"><span class="section-number-2">6</span> Make connections more convenient and secure with public-private keys</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-6">
<p>
Whenever we create a tunnel, we also get a ssh shell on the proxy
server. Usually this is not needed because all that we want is to
forward a port and to create a tunnel.  To avoid this, we can rush the
ssh command with the flags <code>-nNT</code> wich will tell ssh to not allocate a
tty. The command will look like this:
</p>
<pre class="example">
ssh -nNT user@proxy.com -L 2201:localhost:5327
</pre>

<p>
Besides this, it is more convenient and secure to establish the ssh
connection with public-private keys, instead of using passwords.
