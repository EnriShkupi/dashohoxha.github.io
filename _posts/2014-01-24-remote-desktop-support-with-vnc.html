title:      Remote Desktop Support with VNC
date:       2014-01-24
summary:    VNC is a well-known tool for remote desktop view and control.
    Two computers establish a TCP connection so that one of them can access
    the display of the other. However, almost always these two computers
    are behind a firewall/router and do not have a real IP to be accessed
    from the Internet. However, if you have access to an external server
    (for example a server in the cloud) there is still a workaround and
    things can be fixed to work.

VNC is a well-known tool for remote desktop view and control. The two
computers establish a TCP connection so that one of them can access
the display of the other. However, almost always these two computers
are behind a firewall/router and do not have a real IP to be accessed
from the Internet. In such a case one of them can do <b>port forwarding</b>
on the router/firewall and this would allow the connection to be
established. The problem is that more often than not, none of the
parts that want to establish such a remote connection have access to
the firewall that separates/protects it from the real internet.
Sometimes it can even be several levels deep behind the firewall
(several layers of firewalls). However, if you have access to an
external server (for example a server in the cloud) there is still a
workaround and things can be fixed to work. Here I will explain the
tricks and hacks that can be used in such a case in order to establish
a secure connection to a remote desktop.

<div id="outline-container-sec-1" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-1"><span class="section-number-2">1</span> The situation</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
Let's say that we have a computer <b>A</b> that wants to connect to the
desktop of a computer <b>B</b>. Both of them are behind a NAT
router/firewall and cannot modify its settings. However both of them
can access a third computer <b>C</b> that is somewhere on the cloud and
has a real IP.
</p>

<p>
It is possible to use <b>C</b> as a redirecter of the traffic, so that
both computers <b>A</b> and <b>B</b> can establish a direct (peer-to-peer)
connection between them. This is done using the wonderful features
for tunneling and port-forwarding of the <b>SSH</b> protocol. What is
more, this connection will be encrypted and secure, which is the
main feature of the <b>SSH</b> protocol.
</p>

<p>
I will describe in the other sections what should be done in each of
the computers in order to setup such a connection.

<div id="outline-container-sec-2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-2"><span class="section-number-2">2</span> Basic setup</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
On <b>A</b> we need to have a VNC client. Let's install <b>vncviewer</b>:
</p>
<pre class="example">
sudo apt-get install vncviewer
</pre>

<p>
On <b>B</b> we need to have a VNC server. Let's install <b>x11vnc</b>:
</p>
<pre class="example">
sudo apt-get install x11vnc
</pre>

<p>
To connect from <b>A</b> to <b>C</b> and from <b>B</b> to <b>C</b> we can use any
existing account on <b>C</b>. However it is better to create a new one.
Let's call it <b>vnc</b>:
</p>
<pre class="example">
sudo adduser vnc
</pre>

<p>
Let's assume that there is a <b>sshd</b> server running on <b>C</b>
(otherwise there is no way to access it), and let's say that it is
running on the port <b>2201</b>. We will refer to it as <b>middle-server</b>
(which can be an IP or a domain name).
</p>

<p>
To access the desktop of <b>B</b> from <b>A</b>, we first start the VNC
server on <b>B</b>:
</p>
<pre class="example">
ssh -p 2201 -t -R 5933:localhost:5900 vnc@middle-server
x11vnc -rfbport 5900 -localhost -display :0
</pre>
<p>
Then we start the VNC viewer on <b>A</b>:
</p>
<pre class="example">
ssh -p 2201 -t -L 5900:localhost:5933 vnc@middle-server
vncviewer -encodings "copyrect tight zrle hextile" localhost:0
</pre>

<p>
<b>Note:</b> In both cases above, the <b>ssh</b> command and the other
command are given on separate terminal tabs. The <b>ssh</b> command
creates a ssh tunnel to <b>C</b> for the VNC port 5900, which is
mapped to the port 5933 on <b>C</b>.
</p>

<p>
Now we can enjoy the access to the remote desktop.

<div id="outline-container-sec-3" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-3"><span class="section-number-2">3</span> Using a private-public key pair for the ssh connections</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
The <b>SSH</b> protocol allows authentication by a private-publik key
pair. This would be more convenient because this way we don't have
to remember the passsword. Also we can restrict the ssh access only
for what we need it: tunneling and port-forwarding, and prohibit
login etc. 
</p>

<p>
Let's create a private-public key pair for user <code>vnc</code> on <b>C</b>:
</p>
<pre class="example">
su - vnc
mkdir ~/.ssh
chmod 700 ~/.ssh
ssh-keygen -t rsa

ls -al .ssh
total 16
drwx------ 2 vnc vnc 4096 Jan 22 09:31 .
drwxr-xr-x 3 vnc vnc 4096 Jan 22 09:31 ..
-rw------- 1 vnc vnc 1675 Jan 22 09:31 id_rsa
-rw-r--r-- 1 vnc vnc  394 Jan 22 09:31 id_rsa.pub
</pre>

<p>
The public key <code>id_rsa.pub</code> should go to the file <code>authorized_keys</code>,
and the private key <code>id_rsa</code> will be used by <b>A</b> and <b>B</b> to login:
</p>
<pre class="example">
cd ~/.ssh/
cp id_rsa.pub authorized_keys
cp id_rsa vnc.key
</pre>

<p>
Now we can copy <code>vnc.key</code> to <b>A</b> and <b>B</b> and then run the commands
like this:
</p>
<pre class="example">
On B:
ssh -p 2201 -t -R 5933:localhost:5900 -i vnc.key vnc@middle-server
x11vnc -rfbport 5900 -localhost -display :0

On A:
ssh -p 2201 -t -L 5900:localhost:5933 -i vnc.key vnc@middle-server
vncviewer -encodings "copyrect tight zrle hextile" localhost:0
</pre>

<p>
This time no password will be asked for establishing the ssh
connection.
</p>
</div>
</div>


<div id="outline-container-sec-4" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-4"><span class="section-number-2">4</span> Making it more secure</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">
<p>
When we run the <b>ssh</b> command, by default it opens a shell on <b>C</b>
where you can run commands, besides creating a tunnel and doing
port-forwarding. Even if the <b>vnc</b> account that we use for this
purpose may have limited access rights on <b>C</b>, this still is a
potential threat (security problem), especially if we don't know or
cannot trust the person that is sharing the desktop.
</p>

<p>
Fortunately, it is possible to limit the SSH features that each key
can use. We do this by modifying the file <code>authorized_keys</code> to look
like this:
</p>
<pre class="example">
command="/bin/sleep 4294967295",no-agent-forwarding,no-user-rc,
no-X11-forwarding,permitopen="localhost:5933" ssh-rsa B3NzaC1...
</pre>
<p>
The long list of no-xyz statements disallow it from doing just
about anything except connect to a VNC server.
