title:      Visualization with Gourse
date:       2013-12-08
summary:    Recently I made a visualization for contributors to
    https://l10n.org.al for the last two years (2012-2013). This
    visualization was done with gource. It was a bit of hacking,
    so I would like to describe how I did it.

Recently I made <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNCbEVVasto">this visualization</a> for contributors to
<a href="https://l10n.org.al">https://l10n.org.al</a> for the last two years (2012-2013). This
visualization was done with <a href="https://code.google.com/p/gource/">gource</a>. It was a bit of hacking, so I
would like to describe here how I did it.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-sec-1" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-1"><span class="section-number-2">1</span> Getting the data to be visualized</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
For each translation or vote on <a href="https://l10n.org.al/">https://l10n.org.al/</a> the time and
the name of the author is saved as well. So, we would like to get
this information from the database, as well as the project to which
this translation belonged, for all votes and translations.
</p>

<p>
First have a look at this diagram: <a href="https://github.com/B-Translator/B-Translator.github.io/raw/master/docs/uml/db_diagram.png">db_diagram.png</a> just to get an
idea of the structure of the database.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><a href="https://github.com/B-Translator/B-Translator.github.io/raw/master/docs/uml/db_diagram.png"><img src="https://github.com/B-Translator/B-Translator.github.io/raw/master/docs/uml/db_diagram.png" alt="db_diagram.png" /></a>
</p>
</div>

<p>
Then look at the script below which I used to extract the data.
</p>

{% highlight bash %}
#!/bin/bash
query="
  SELECT v.time, u.name, (v.time=t.time) AS new, project, origin
  FROM votes v
  LEFT JOIN users u ON (u.ulng = v.ulng AND u.umail = v.umail)
  LEFT JOIN translations t ON (t.tguid = v.tguid)
  LEFT JOIN strings s ON (s.sguid = t.sguid)
  LEFT JOIN locations l ON (l.sguid = s.sguid)
  LEFT JOIN templates tpl ON (tpl.potid = l.potid)
  LEFT JOIN projects p ON (p.pguid = tpl.pguid)
"
mysql -u root -D btranslator_data -B -e "$query" > contrib.txt
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
This is simply a join of the tables and extracting the fields that
are needed. When the time of vote is the same as the time of
translation, then this is a new translation and the field <code>new</code> is
true.
</p>
</div>
</div>


<div id="outline-container-sec-2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-2"><span class="section-number-2">2</span> Transforming data to the right format</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
In the result file <code>contrib.txt</code> fields are separated by TAB, so
first I replaced tabs with commas (,) for easy processing. I did it
with find/replace on Emacs, but any other editor can do this.
</p>

<p>
Gource expects the input file (which is called log file) in the
format <code>timestamp|username|action|filename</code>. Gource was designed to
work with version control systems (like git, subversion, etc.) in
order to visualize the project activity, so the <code>action</code> is expected
to be A, or M, or D etc. (respectively for adding, modifying,
deleting a file) and <code>filename</code> is the file that was touched.
</p>

<p>
I had to transform the data to this format and I did it with a script
like this:
</p>
{% highlight bash %}
#!/bin/bash

while read l
do
    time=$(echo $l | cut -d, -f1)
    name=$(echo $l | cut -d, -f2)
    new=$(echo $l | cut -d, -f3)
    project=$(echo $l | cut -d, -f4)
    origin=$(echo $l | cut -d, -f5)
    timestamp=$(date -d "$time" +%s)  # convert to timestamp
    if [ "$new" = "1" ]; then action='A'; else action='M'; fi
    path="/$origin/$project"
    echo "$timestamp|$name|$action|$path"
done < contrib.txt > contrib.log  
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
I also made sure that there are no lines containing NULL and that
the file is sorted in increasing order by the timestamp:
</p>
<pre class="example">
sed -i contrib.log -e '/NULL/d'

sort -t'|' -k1 contrib.log &gt; contrib-1.log
rm contrib.log
mv contrib-1.log contrib.log
</pre>
</div>
</div>


<div id="outline-container-sec-3" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-3"><span class="section-number-2">3</span> Feeding the data to gource and generating the output</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
First make sure that the tools that we need are installed:
</p>
<pre class="example">
sudo apt-get install gource ffmpeg
</pre>

<p>
Then generate the video with a script like this:  
</p>
<pre class="example">
#!/bin/bash

gource contrib.log -s 0.1 -i 0 --max-files 0 \
       --date-format "%B %Y" --hide dirnames,filenames \
       -640x360 -o - \
  | ffmpeg -y -r 25 -f image2pipe -vcodec ppm -i - \
           -vcodec libvpx -b 10000K contrib.webm
</pre>

<p>
How did I know that these are the right options? I didn't know
(especially for <code>ffmpeg</code>), I simply googled and found some examples,
then I played with some options of <code>gource</code> in order to get it
right.
