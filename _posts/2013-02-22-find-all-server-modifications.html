title:      How to find all the modifications in the configuration of a server
date:       2013-02-22
summary:    I manage a virtual web server in the cloud where I have made lots
    of configurations over time (installing new packages, tweakings for
    optimization, changes related to security, etc.) If I want to build
    another server that has the same function and purpose as the first
    one, I don't remember all the things that I have touched and
    changed. The long and tedious way would be to go over all the
    installations and configurations again, and still I may miss
    something.

I manage a virtual web server in the cloud (<a href="https://l10n.org.al">https://l10n.org.al</a>) where
I have made lots of configurations over time: installing new packages,
tweakings for optimization, changes related to security, etc. Now, if
I want to build another server that has the same function and purpose
as the first one, I don't remember all the things that I have touched
and changed. The long and tedious way would be to go over all the
installations and configurations again, and still I may miss
something.
</p>

<p>
I thought that maybe there is any tool out there that can make
something like a diff between the current state of the server and the
initial state of a just installed server. This diff would also help me
to audit the current system, because some of the things that I have
tested maybe are not needed anymore. Such a diff could also serve as a
recipe that I can share with my friends, if they want to build a
system like mine. It would be much more convenient and safe than
passing around huge tarballs or images.
</p>

<p>
However I couldn't find anything suitable that can do it
automatically, so I tried to do it manually. The basic idea is that
the configuration files are placed on/etc. If two systems have the
same packages installed, and you make a diff of their /etc
directories, you will basically get all the configuration changes
between them (maybe not 100% of them but still very accurate).
</p>

<p>
So, what I did to find the configuration changes on my system was
this:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Install a minimal system with debootstrap:

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Install the packages debootstrap and dchroot:
<pre class="example">
sudo apt-get install debootstrap dchroot
</pre>
</li>

<li>Add these line to <code>/etc/schroot/schroot.conf</code>:
<pre class="example">
[precise]
description=Ubuntu Precise LTS
location=/var/chroot/precise
priority=3
users=ubuntu
groups=sbuild
root-groups=root
</pre>
</li>

<li>Bootstrap the chroot with a minimal Ubuntu installation:
<pre class="example">
debootstrap --variant=minbase --arch=amd64 precise \
    /var/chroot/precise http://mirror.rackspace.com/ubuntu/
cp /etc/resolv.conf /var/chroot/precise/etc/resolv.conf
cp /etc/apt/sources.list /var/chroot/precise/etc/apt/
mount -o bind /proc /var/chroot/precise/proc
chroot /var/chroot/precise/ apt-get install ubuntu-minimal
</pre>
</li>
</ol>
</li>

<li>Make sure to install on the chroot system all the packages that
are installed on the main system:

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Find a list of the packages installed in the main (host)
system:
<pre class="example">
dpkg --get-selections \
  | grep '[[:space:]]install$' \
  | awk '{print $1}' &gt; installedpackages
</pre>
</li>

<li>Find a list of the packages installed in the chroot system:
<pre class="example">
chroot /var/chroot/precise/  dpkg --get-selections \
  | grep '[[:space:]]install$' \
  | awk '{print $1}' &gt; installedpackages_chroot
</pre>
</li>

<li>Make a diff between the two package lists:
<pre class="example">
diff -ubB installedpackages installedpackages_chroot &gt; packages.diff
Install on the chroot system all the packages that are installed on the main system:
cp installedpackages /var/chroot/precise/
chroot /var/chroot/precise/
cat installedpackages | xargs apt-get install -y
</pre>
</li>
</ol>
</li>

<li>Make a diff between the /etc dirs of both systems:
<pre class="example">
diff -rubB /etc /var/chroot/precise/etc &gt; etc.diff
</pre>
</li>
</ol>

<p>
Of course, this diff cannot be readily used to install and configure
another system, but knowing where are the differences and what they
are, can help to redo them manually.
</p>

<p>
It can also help to build a tklpatch (like this:
<a href="https://github.com/dashohoxha/B-Translator/tree/master/tklpatch">https://github.com/dashohoxha/B-Translator/tree/master/tklpatch</a>),
which of course is not quite easy to be done and requires some
work. Then, I can distribute/publish this tklpatch and everybody can
build easily a system quite similar to mine.
