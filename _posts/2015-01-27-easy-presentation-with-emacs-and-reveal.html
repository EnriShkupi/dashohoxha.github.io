<p>
Recently I had to prepare a presentation for a workshop. I knew that
org-mode of Emacs could be used for presentations as well, but I
hadn't tried it yet. After some research, I decided to go with
<a href="https://github.com/yjwen/org-reveal">org-reveal</a>, which can generate very nice online presentations.
</p>

<p>
I already had Emacs and org-mode installed. If you don't have
org-mode version 8.0 or later (check it with <code>M-x org-version</code>), you
should update it. You can do it like this:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Go to the list of packages: <code>M-x package-list-packages</code>
</li>
<li>Find the package org: <code>C-s org</code>
</li>
<li>Go to it and press <code>&lt;Enter&gt;</code>
</li>
<li>Install it by clicking on <code>[Install]</code>
</li>
</ol>

<p>
To install org-reval, we first get it from GitHub:
</p>
<pre class="example">
git clone https://github.com/yjwen/org-reveal.git
</pre>
<p>
Then we need to copy <code>ox-reveal.el</code> to the org-mode installation
directory. In my case, I did it like this:
</p>
<pre class="example">
cp org-reveal/ox-reveal.el ~/.emacs.d/elpa/org-20141124/
</pre>

<p>
At the begining of the org file I set some REVEAL options like these:
</p>
<pre class="example">
#+TITLE:     Building Our Website on GitHub With Jekyll
#+AUTHOR:    Dashamir Hoxha
#+EMAIL:     dashohoxha@gmail.com
#+DATE:      2015-01-28
#+REVEAL_ROOT: http://cdn.jsdelivr.net/reveal.js/2.5.0/
#+REVEAL-SLIDE-NUMBER: t
#+REVEAL_THEME: sky
#+REVEAL_TRANS: linear
</pre>
<p>
You can also see how the whole org file looks like: <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dashohoxha/dashohoxha.github.io/master/github-website/github-website.org">github-website.org</a>
</p>

<p>
To wake-up org-reveal, type <code>M-x load-library</code>, then type <code>ox-reveal</code>.
To export the org file into Reveal.js presentation, type <code>C-c C-e R R</code>.
The resulting HTML file looks like this: <a href="http://dashohoxha.fs.al/github-website/">http://dashohoxha.fs.al/github-website/</a>
</p>
